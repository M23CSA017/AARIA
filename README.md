# AARIA# AARIA: Autonomous Agentic Research and Information Assistant

This repository contains the implementations of two distinct research workflows for synthesizing and automating research processes:

1. **Single-Agent Research Workflow**
2. **Multi-Agent Research Workflow Using CREW AI**

These workflows provide two perspectives on automating research tasks, showcasing the evolution from a simpler, centralized system to a more efficient, decentralized, and scalable design.

## Overview

### 1. **Single-Agent Research Workflow**

The single-agent architecture focuses on simplicity and ease of integration, where a single "Oracle" agent handles all tasks from query generation to final synthesis.

### 2. **Multi-Agent Research Workflow Using CREW AI**

The multi-agent architecture uses CREW AI to distribute tasks across specialized agents, enabling modularity, scalability, and improved performance for complex research workflows.

## Features

### Common Features

- **Integrated Web Search**: Uses DuckDuckGo for private and efficient web queries.
- **Language Model (LLM)**: Leverages Cohere for generating and analyzing textual content.

### Single-Agent Workflow

- **Centralized Control**: A single agent orchestrates the entire workflow.
- **Integrated Tools**: Specialized tools like `rag_search_filter`, `fetch_arxiv`, and `final_answer` streamline research synthesis.
- **Simple Database Integration**: Utilizes Redis for document storage and retrieval.

### Multi-Agent Workflow

- **Distributed Task Management**: Seven specialized agents handle distinct tasks, including query creation, information retrieval, synthesis, critique, and feedback processing.
- **Dynamic Query Generation**: Enhances relevance and adaptability of searches.
- **Self-Improvement**: A critique agent ensures iterative improvements to outputs.
- **Efficient Feedback Mechanism**: A human feedback agent evaluates user input for refining outputs or restarting tasks.

## Architecture

### Single-Agent Workflow

The single-agent architecture centralizes decision-making within an Oracle agent. While this ensures simplicity, it faces scalability challenges for complex workflows.

### Multi-Agent Workflow

The multi-agent design distributes responsibilities among specialized agents, each focusing on a unique subtask. CREW AI ensures smooth communication and task delegation, making this system adaptable and scalable.

## Key Improvements from Single-Agent to Multi-Agent

| Feature             | Single-Agent Workflow | Multi-Agent Workflow      |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Task Management     | Centralized           | Distributed across agents |
| Query Generation    | Static                | Dynamic and optimized     |
| Scalability         | Limited               | Highly scalable           |
| Self-Critique       | Absent                | Integrated critique agent |
| Feedback Processing | Manual                | Automated and efficient   |

## Limitations

### Single-Agent Workflow

- Bottleneck due to centralized task handling.
- Static queries with no optimization for context.
- Limited ability for iterative improvements.
- Challenges in managing recursive workflows.

### Multi-Agent Workflow

- Increased complexity in implementation and coordination.
- Higher computational overhead due to multiple agents.

## Conclusion

This repository demonstrates the evolution of automated research workflows:

1. The **Single-Agent Workflow** is ideal for small-scale, straightforward tasks, providing simplicity and ease of integration.
2. The **Multi-Agent Workflow Using CREW AI** offers a robust solution for complex, large-scale research automation, emphasizing modularity, scalability, and iterative improvements.

By combining these workflows, this repository provides a comprehensive view of the possibilities for automating research processes.
